# Right-Sizing: Replace Placement API with In-Memory Predicate Evaluation

## Review Concern

The following review comment was raised against `ensureRSPlacement()` and the surrounding Placement API usage:

> **`ensureRSPlacement` / `deleteRSPlacement` / `deleteOrphanRSPlacements` / `isClusterSelectedByRSPlacement`**
>
> "As discussed, I don't think this use of the placement API by RS for such a meta addon deploying several 'independent' stacks doesn't scale well. To be discussed in the arch call."

The concern is that **each feature stack in MCOA independently creating and managing its own Placement resources on the hub is architecturally wrong for a meta addon**. MCOA deploys several independent stacks — metrics collection, logging, tracing, incident detection, right-sizing (namespace + virtualization) — and if each one replicates the same pattern of creating Placement resources, waiting for PlacementDecisions, and handling lifecycle (create, update, delete, orphan cleanup, race conditions), it leads to:

1. **Hub resource sprawl** — every feature adds its own Placement + PlacementDecision resources to the hub
2. **Duplicated boilerplate** — each new feature needs ~160 lines of identical Placement CRUD code
3. **Unnecessary external dependency** — coupling to the OCM placement scheduler when the addon framework already handles cluster targeting via InstallStrategy
4. **Fragile race windows** — between Placement creation and PlacementDecision availability, with fail-open defaults that can deploy to wrong clusters

This change addresses all of these concerns by moving cluster selection from external Placement resources to in-memory predicate evaluation.

## Motivation

MCOA is a "meta addon" that deploys several independent stacks (metrics collection, logging, tracing, incident detection, right-sizing). The previous implementation had right-sizing (RS) creating its own `Placement` resources on the hub and relying on the OCM placement scheduler to produce `PlacementDecision` resources for cluster selection.

If every feature stack replicated the same pattern — creating Placement resources, waiting for PlacementDecisions, managing lifecycle (create, update, delete, orphan cleanup) — the hub would accumulate many feature-specific Placement resources and the codebase would carry significant boilerplate for each new feature.

## Problem — What the Old Implementation Did

### Hub-Side (ResourceCreator)

`ReconcileRSResources()` ran on every reconcile and performed:

1. **Orphan cleanup** — Listed all Placements with RS labels across all namespaces and deleted any outside `open-cluster-management-global-set` (to handle MCO mode-switch leftovers).
2. **Placement create/update** — For each enabled RS feature, read the ConfigMap, extracted `placementConfiguration`, and called `ensureRSPlacement()` which:
   - Fetched the Placement by name.
   - If not found, created it with the spec from ConfigMap.
   - If `AlreadyExists` (race condition), re-fetched and fell through to update.
   - If found, updated the spec.
3. **Placement delete** — For each disabled RS feature, deleted the corresponding Placement.
4. **ConfigMap delete** — For each disabled RS feature, deleted the ConfigMap.

### Per-Cluster (Build)

`Build()` called `isClusterSelectedByRSPlacement()` for each RS feature, which:

1. Listed all `PlacementDecision` resources in `open-cluster-management-global-set` matching the Placement name label.
2. If no PlacementDecisions existed yet (scheduler hasn't caught up), **defaulted to selected** (fail-open) to avoid blocking deployment.
3. Iterated all decisions checking if the cluster name appeared.

### Constants Required

```go
PlacementNamespace      = "open-cluster-management-global-set"
NamespacePlacementName  = "rs-placement"
VirtualizationPlacementName = "rs-virt-placement"
PlacementDecisionLabel  = "cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement"
```

### Problems

| Problem | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Doesn't scale** | Every new feature stack would need the same Placement lifecycle management |
| **External dependency** | Relies on OCM placement scheduler running and producing PlacementDecisions |
| **Race window** | Between Placement creation and PlacementDecision availability, `Build()` defaulted to fail-open (selected=true), potentially deploying to wrong clusters briefly |
| **Namespace dependency** | Required `open-cluster-management-global-set` to have a `ManagedClusterSetBinding` |
| **Orphan management** | Needed cross-namespace listing and cleanup for mode switches (MCO <-> MCOA) |
| **Code volume** | ~160 lines of Placement CRUD, orphan cleanup, and PlacementDecision reading |

## Solution — In-Memory Predicate Evaluation

Replace all Placement API usage with a pure function that evaluates the placement predicates in-memory against the `ManagedCluster` object already available in `Build()`.

### Key Insight

The `ManagedCluster` object passed to `Build()` already contains everything needed for cluster selection:

- `cluster.Labels` — for label-based predicates
- `cluster.Status.ClusterClaims` — for claim-based predicates

There is no need to create external resources and wait for a scheduler when we can evaluate the same predicates locally.

### New Function: `clusterMatchesPlacement()`

```go
func clusterMatchesPlacement(cluster *clusterv1.ManagedCluster, placement clusterv1beta1.Placement) bool
```

Evaluates placement predicates following OCM semantics:

- **Empty predicates** → match all clusters (default behavior)
- **Multiple predicates** → ORed (any match selects the cluster)
- **Within a predicate** → `LabelSelector` and `ClaimSelector` are ANDed
- **LabelSelector** → uses `metav1.LabelSelectorAsSelector()` for both `matchLabels` and `matchExpressions`
- **ClaimSelector** → evaluates `matchExpressions` against `cluster.Status.ClusterClaims` using `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist` operators

## Concerns Addressed

| Concern from Review | How This Change Addresses It |
|---------------------|------------------------------|
| **"doesn't scale well"** — each feature creating its own Placements | Eliminated entirely. No Placement resources are created on the hub. Cluster selection is a pure function call during `Build()`. A new feature only needs to call `clusterMatchesPlacement()` — zero hub resources, zero lifecycle management. |
| **Hub resource sprawl** — RS alone created 2 Placements + PlacementDecisions | Zero hub Placement resources. The only hub resources RS manages are ConfigMaps (which store the user-facing configuration). |
| **Duplicated boilerplate** — ~160 lines of Placement CRUD per feature | Replaced with ~80 lines of reusable matching logic. Any feature can call `clusterMatchesPlacement(cluster, config)` — one line, no error handling needed, no context or client required. |
| **External scheduler dependency** — relied on OCM placement scheduler | Removed. Predicates are evaluated locally against the `ManagedCluster` object already available in `Build()`. No external controller needs to be running. |
| **Race window** — fail-open default between Placement creation and PlacementDecision | Eliminated. In-memory evaluation is synchronous — the result is immediately available, no window where wrong clusters could be selected. |
| **Namespace dependency** — required `open-cluster-management-global-set` with `ManagedClusterSetBinding` | Removed. No namespace dependency for Placement resources. |
| **Orphan cleanup** — cross-namespace listing and deletion for MCO mode switches | No longer needed. No Placement resources exist to become orphaned. |
| **"meta addon deploying independent stacks"** — pattern doesn't fit addon-framework model | Aligned with the addon-framework model: Level 1 (InstallStrategy) handles which clusters get the addon, Level 2 (in-memory predicates from ConfigMap) handles per-feature filtering within `Build()`. No feature bypasses or duplicates the framework's placement mechanism. |

## Changes Summary

### Files Changed (6 files, +302 / -336 lines)

#### `internal/analytics/rightsizing/handlers/handler.go`

**Added** `clusterMatchesPlacement()` and helpers (~80 lines):

- `clusterMatchesPlacement()` — entry point, handles empty predicates and OR semantics
- `clusterMatchesPredicate()` — evaluates a single `ClusterPredicate` (AND of label + claim)
- `clusterMatchesLabelSelector()` — uses `metav1.LabelSelectorAsSelector()` for standard label matching
- `clusterMatchesClaimSelector()` — maps cluster claims to a lookup table, evaluates `matchExpressions`

**Changed** `Build()` — replaced two `isClusterSelectedByRSPlacement()` calls (5 lines each, with error handling and fail-open default) with single-line `clusterMatchesPlacement()` calls:

```go
// Before (for each RS feature)
nsSelected, err := o.isClusterSelectedByRSPlacement(ctx, rightsizing.NamespacePlacementName, cluster.Name)
if err != nil {
    o.Logger.Error(err, "Failed to check namespace placement selection, defaulting to selected")
    nsSelected = true
}

// After
nsSelected := clusterMatchesPlacement(cluster, nsConfigData.PlacementConfiguration)
```

#### `internal/analytics/rightsizing/handlers/rs_resources.go`

**Removed** (~160 lines):

- `ensureRSPlacement()` — create/update Placement with AlreadyExists race handling
- `isClusterSelectedByRSPlacement()` — list PlacementDecisions and check for cluster
- `deleteRSPlacement()` — delete a Placement by name
- `deleteOrphanRSPlacements()` — cross-namespace orphan cleanup

**Simplified** `ReconcileRSResources()` — from ~55 lines (orphan cleanup + Placement lifecycle + ConfigMap lifecycle for each feature) to ~15 lines (ConfigMap cleanup only for disabled features):

```go
func (o *OptionsBuilder) ReconcileRSResources(ctx context.Context, opts addon.Options) error {
    if !opts.Platform.AnalyticsOptions.RightSizing.NamespaceEnabled {
        if err := o.deleteRSConfigMap(ctx, rightsizing.NamespaceConfigMapName); err != nil {
            return fmt.Errorf("failed to cleanup namespace configmap: %w", err)
        }
    }
    if !opts.Platform.AnalyticsOptions.RightSizing.VirtualizationEnabled {
        if err := o.deleteRSConfigMap(ctx, rightsizing.VirtualizationConfigMapName); err != nil {
            return fmt.Errorf("failed to cleanup virtualization configmap: %w", err)
        }
    }
    return nil
}
```

**Removed imports**: `metav1`, `clusterv1beta1`, `client` (no longer needed).

#### `internal/analytics/rightsizing/types.go`

**Removed constants** (no longer needed):

```go
PlacementNamespace         = "open-cluster-management-global-set"
NamespacePlacementName     = "rs-placement"
VirtualizationPlacementName = "rs-virt-placement"
PlacementDecisionLabel     = "cluster.open-cluster-management.io/placement"
```

#### `internal/analytics/rightsizing/handlers/rs_resources_test.go`

**Removed tests** for Placement lifecycle (no longer applicable):

- `TestReconcileRSResources_CleansOrphanPlacements`
- `TestReconcileRSResources_IgnoresNonRSPlacements`
- `TestReconcileRSResources_OrphanCleanupWithDisabledFeatures`
- `TestReconcileRSResources_PlatformDisabledCleansUp`

**Simplified** existing ConfigMap cleanup tests — removed Placement assertions, kept ConfigMap-only assertions.

**Added tests** for in-memory matching (10 test functions):

| Test | What It Verifies |
|------|------------------|
| `TestClusterMatchesPlacement_EmptyPredicates` | Default placement (empty predicates) matches all clusters |
| `TestClusterMatchesPlacement_LabelMatch` | `matchLabels` selects cluster with matching labels |
| `TestClusterMatchesPlacement_LabelNoMatch` | `matchLabels` rejects cluster without matching labels |
| `TestClusterMatchesPlacement_LabelExpressions` | `matchExpressions` with `In` operator works |
| `TestClusterMatchesPlacement_ClaimMatch` | Claim selector `In` matches cluster claim values |
| `TestClusterMatchesPlacement_ClaimNoMatch` | Claim selector `In` rejects non-matching claim values |
| `TestClusterMatchesPlacement_PredicatesORed` | Two predicates — second matches, cluster is selected |
| `TestClusterMatchesPlacement_ClaimDoesNotExist` | `DoesNotExist` operator matches absent claims |
| `TestClusterMatchesPlacement_CombinedLabelAndClaim` | Label AND claim within one predicate — both must match |

#### `internal/analytics/rightsizing/builder.go`

**Updated comment** on `GetDefaultRSPlacement()` — reflects in-memory evaluation instead of OCM scheduler.

#### `internal/controllers/resourcecreator/controller.go`

**Updated comment** on ConfigMap watch — removed "(for placement updates)" since Placement resources no longer exist.

## Non-Matching Resources

When a feature is globally enabled but a cluster does not match the placement predicate, `Build()` omits the non-matching resources from the ManifestWork. The OCM work agent detects resources tracked in `AppliedManifestWork` that are absent from the current ManifestWork spec (`FindUntrackedResources`) and deletes them from the spoke (`DeleteAppliedResources`).

**Important:** This deletion mechanism only works when the ManifestWork reaches `Applied: True`. If any resource in the ManifestWork fails to apply (e.g., a missing CRD), the work agent does not perform untracked resource cleanup. For this reason, the ScrapeConfig is only included when `Platform.Metrics.CollectionEnabled` is true — metrics collection guarantees the `scrapeconfigs.monitoring.rhobs` CRD exists on the spoke (deployed by the bundled operator or by COO). Without this gate, the ScrapeConfig would permanently fail to apply, blocking the ManifestWork and preventing PrometheusRule cleanup on label changes.

## Backward Compatibility

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| ConfigMap format (`placementConfiguration` field) | **Unchanged** — existing user customizations preserved |
| Default behavior (empty predicates = all clusters) | **Unchanged** |
| Predicate semantics (OR across predicates, AND within) | **Unchanged** — mirrors OCM placement scheduler behavior |
| Level 1 InstallStrategy | **Unchanged** — addon framework handles this independently |
| ConfigMap watch in ResourceCreator | **Retained** — config changes still trigger reconciliation |
| `RSConfigMapPredicate` | **Retained** — still filters ConfigMap events |

## Two-Level Architecture Preserved

The two-level placement architecture remains intact:

- **Level 1 (InstallStrategy):** Addon-framework built-in — determines which clusters get MCOA ManifestWork at all. **Unchanged.**
- **Level 2 (RS ConfigMap):** Determines which clusters get namespace vs virtualization RS within those ManifestWorks. **Same functional outcome, different implementation** — predicates evaluated in-memory instead of via Placement API + OCM scheduler.

## What Is No Longer Needed

- No `Placement` resources created on the hub
- No dependency on `open-cluster-management-global-set` namespace or `ManagedClusterSetBinding`
- No `PlacementDecision` reading or fail-open race window
- No cross-namespace orphan cleanup for mode switches
- No Placement-related constants (`PlacementNamespace`, `NamespacePlacementName`, etc.)

## Capability Impact Assessment

This change does **not** compromise any right-sizing capability. The `PlacementSpec` has 7 fields — here is the full audit of each.

### Fully Supported — Capabilities RS Uses

These are the features RS actually relies on for cluster selection. All produce identical results to the old Placement API approach.

| Capability | Old (Placement API) | New (In-Memory) | Verdict |
|-----------|-----|-----|---------|
| **Label predicates** — `matchLabels`, `matchExpressions` | OCM scheduler evaluates | `clusterMatchesLabelSelector()` via `metav1.LabelSelectorAsSelector()` | **Identical** |
| **Claim predicates** — `matchExpressions` on cluster claims | OCM scheduler evaluates | `clusterMatchesClaimSelector()` with `In`/`NotIn`/`Exists`/`DoesNotExist` | **Identical** |
| **Multiple predicates (ORed)** | OCM scheduler ORs them | `clusterMatchesPlacement()` loop with early return on first match | **Identical** |
| **LabelSelector + ClaimSelector (ANDed)** | OCM scheduler ANDs them | `clusterMatchesPredicate()` checks both, short-circuits on first failure | **Identical** |
| **Empty predicates = all clusters** | OCM scheduler selects all matching | Returns `true` immediately | **Identical** |

### Not Supported — Features RS Never Used

These are OCM scheduler-specific scheduling features. None were ever configured in RS ConfigMaps, and none are meaningful for deploying PrometheusRules to clusters.

| Feature | Why It's Not Relevant to RS |
|---------|----------------------------|
| **NumberOfClusters** | RS deploys recording rules to *all* matching clusters. Randomly picking N clusters makes no sense. Never configured in ConfigMap. |
| **PrioritizerPolicy** | Scoring/ranking clusters for when `NumberOfClusters` limits selection. Only relevant with `NumberOfClusters`, which RS doesn't use. |
| **SpreadPolicy** | Distributes decisions across topologies (regions, zones). RS doesn't do workload scheduling — it deploys the same rules everywhere. |
| **DecisionStrategy** | Groups PlacementDecisions for staged rollout. RS deploys the same rules to all selected clusters simultaneously. |
| **CelSelector** | CEL expressions on ManagedCluster fields. Never documented or used in RS ConfigMaps. Theoretical gap only. |

### Tolerations — Different Mechanism, Same Result

The old default placement had explicit tolerations for `unreachable` and `unavailable` taints so the OCM scheduler would still select tainted clusters. The new approach doesn't evaluate tolerations at all, but the effective behavior is **the same**:

- `Build()` is called for every cluster selected by Level 1 (InstallStrategy).
- If a cluster is unreachable, `Build()` is still invoked and in-memory evaluation matches it based on predicates — same as the old toleration-based approach.
- The ManifestWork will be pending for unreachable clusters and applied when they come back. This is the correct and expected behavior.

### One Thing That's Actually Better

The old fail-open race window is **eliminated**. Previously, between Placement creation and PlacementDecision availability (typically 10–30 seconds), `isClusterSelectedByRSPlacement()` returned `true` by default:

```go
// Old code in isClusterSelectedByRSPlacement:
if len(placementDecisionList.Items) == 0 {
    // No PlacementDecisions yet — Placement may be newly created.
    // Default to true (fail-open)
    return true, nil
}
```

This meant RS could briefly deploy to clusters it shouldn't have. With in-memory evaluation, the result is synchronous and deterministic — no window, no wrong deployments.

### ClusterSets — Also Better

The old code created Placements in `open-cluster-management-global-set`, scoping selection to clusters in that ManagedClusterSet. With in-memory evaluation, selection operates on whatever clusters `Build()` is called for — already filtered by Level 1 (InstallStrategy). This is **more flexible**: no longer limited to a specific ManagedClusterSet, and no dependency on `ManagedClusterSetBinding` existing in the right namespace.

### Summary

| Category | Count | Impact on RS |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Fully supported (RS uses these) | 5 capabilities | **Zero** — identical results |
| Not supported (RS never used these) | 5 capabilities | **Zero** — scheduling features irrelevant to RS |
| Different mechanism, same result | 1 (tolerations) | **Zero** — same effective behavior |
| Actually improved | 2 (race window, ClusterSets) | **Positive** — eliminates fail-open window and namespace constraint |

## MCO-Safe Placement Configuration

### Problem

The MCO controller periodically syncs the RS ConfigMaps (`rs-namespace-config`, `rs-virt-config`), fully overwriting their `data` section. This resets any custom `placementConfiguration` the user has added. Since MCO writes default empty predicates (which match all clusters), custom placement filtering is lost after every MCO sync cycle.

### Solution: Dedicated Placement ConfigMaps

Placement configuration is stored in **separate, MCOA-owned ConfigMaps** that MCO does not know about and will never overwrite:

| ConfigMap | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `rs-namespace-placement` | Placement predicates for namespace right-sizing |
| `rs-virt-placement` | Placement predicates for virtualization right-sizing |

These ConfigMaps use the same `placementConfiguration` key format as the RS ConfigMaps. MCOA checks for these first; if found, their placement takes priority. If not found, MCOA falls back to the placement from the RS ConfigMap (which MCO manages).

### Precedence

```
rs-namespace-placement exists?
  ├─ Yes → use its placementConfiguration (MCO cannot overwrite)
  └─ No  → use rs-namespace-config.placementConfiguration (MCO-managed, may be default)
```

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: rs-namespace-placement
  namespace: open-cluster-management-addon-observability
  labels:
    observability.open-cluster-management.io/managed-by: analytics-rightsizing
data:
  placementConfiguration: |
    {"spec":{"predicates":[{"requiredClusterSelector":{"labelSelector":{"matchLabels":{"env":"prod"}}}}]}}
```

This ensures `env=prod` clusters receive namespace right-sizing even when MCO syncs and overwrites `rs-namespace-config`.
